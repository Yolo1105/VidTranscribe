# Video Downloader & Transcriber Tool

## Introduction

This tool automates the process of downloading videos from various sources, extracting the audio, and converting that audio into readable text transcripts. It leverages `yt-dlp` to download videos, `ffmpeg` to extract audio, and `faster-whisper` to transcribe the audio into text. The entire process is designed for ease of use, allowing you to download and transcribe videos (even those that require authentication via cookies) into readable, searchable text documents.

### How It Works:
1. **Download Videos**: Using `yt-dlp`, the tool fetches video files from URLs like Zoom, YouTube, and more.
2. **Extract Audio**: Once the video is downloaded, `ffmpeg` extracts the audio to a processable format (e.g., WAV).
3. **Transcribe Audio**: The `faster-whisper` model transcribes the extracted audio into a text file, providing a readable transcript of the video content.

## Installation

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before setting up the environment, ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed. Here are platform-specific instructions:

- **macOS**: Install via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

- **Ubuntu/Linux**: Install via apt:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```

- **Windows**: Download `ffmpeg` from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), unzip it, and add the `ffmpeg` executable to your system’s PATH.

### Step 2: Set up a Conda Environment

1. **Create a new Conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name nme python=3.8
   ```

2. **Activate the environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate nme
   ```

3. **Install dependencies in the Conda environment**:
   You can either use `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies. Choose one of the following options:

### Option 1: Install via `setup.py`

Once the Conda environment is activated, you can run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

This will install all the required packages, as listed in the `requirements.txt`, and set up the tool.

### Option 2: Install via `requirements.txt`

Alternatively, you can install dependencies directly using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Extensions & Dependencies Overview

Here’s a detailed explanation of the key dependencies used in this project:

1. **yt-dlp**:
   - A command-line tool used to download videos from a variety of websites, including YouTube, Zoom, and others. It supports video formats and cookies for authenticated downloads.
   
2. **faster-whisper**:
   - A more optimized implementation of OpenAI's Whisper model, used to transcribe audio into text with improved speed and memory usage. This tool is crucial for converting the extracted audio into readable text.

3. **ffmpeg-python**:
   - A Python wrapper for the `ffmpeg` multimedia processing tool. This is used to extract audio from the downloaded videos, converting them into a format that can be processed by the transcription model.

4. **ffmpeg (system-level dependency)**:
   - A multimedia framework used for video and audio processing. This tool is installed on your system and called by the Python script to extract the audio from the video.

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Download Videos
- The tool uses `yt-dlp` to download videos from the URLs specified, even if the videos require authentication via a `cookies.txt` file.

### Step 2: Extract Audio
- After downloading, `ffmpeg` extracts the audio from the downloaded video file.

### Step 3: Transcribe Audio
- The audio is passed to the `faster-whisper` model, which transcribes it into a text file. This generates two types of output:
  1. **SRT file**: A subtitle file with timestamps for each segment.
  2. **Text file**: A plain text transcript of the entire video.

### Example of the Code:

```python
# main.py

import os
from download import download_videos
from extract_audio import extract_audio
from transcribe import transcribe_audio
from write_transcripts import write_transcripts

# Path to the cookies.txt file
cookies_path = r"C:\Users\mohan\OneDrive\Desktop\Tools\cookies.txt"

# List of video URLs to download
video_links = [
    "https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/play/4CP7hk6rPqudQ_ktNhHRKCy_1swT-7BwTE9gof9s_CexRQfGddIuBxkZ5efRU2wDrU7vGXO5GsGy9gyl.zVGGcpP7ctYnTOSt",
]

# Uncomment the steps you want to execute

# Step 1: Download videos
# download_videos(video_links, cookies_path)

# Assuming the video is downloaded and you know the video file name.
downloaded_video = "downloaded_video.mp4"  # Replace with actual video filename
audio_file = "extracted_audio.wav"

# Step 2: Extract audio from the video
# Uncomment the line below if you want to extract audio
# extract_audio(downloaded_video, audio_file)

# Step 3: Transcribe the audio
# Uncomment the line below if you want to transcribe the audio
# transcript = transcribe_audio(audio_file, model_size="base")

# Step 4: Write the transcripts to files
# Uncomment the line below if you want to save the transcripts
# write_transcripts(transcript, srt_filename="transcript.srt", combined_filename="c_transcript.txt")
```

---

## Example Files Generated:

1. **transcript.srt**:
   - A subtitle file with timestamps and text segments.
  
2. **c_transcript.txt**:
   - A plain text file containing the entire transcription, with each sentence separated by a comma.

## Summary

This tool streamlines the process of downloading, extracting, and transcribing videos into readable text files. With this setup, you can easily automate video-to-text conversion for a variety of platforms, making content more accessible and easier to work with.

Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed on your system, and use Conda to manage the required packages.
